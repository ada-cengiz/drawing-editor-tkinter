Drawing Editor : Interactive Shape Design Tool (Tkinter)

A desktop drawing app built in Python using Tkinter, designed for basic shape creation, manipulation, and playful user interaction. Created as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course, the tool emphasizes usability, feedback, and fun through features like drag-and-drop, undo/redo, random color mode, and animations.

Project Highlights: 
* Interactive GUI with a drawing canvas
* Draw basic shapes: circles, rectangles, lines
* Click-and-drag functionality for moving and resizing shapes
* Color picker and random color mode for creativity
* Undo, redo, and delete shape functions
* Hover effects and user feedback (animations, message boxes)
* Shape counter for real-time tracking

Tech Stack:
* Python 3
* Tkinter GUI library
* random module for color behavior

HCI Design Goals:

This project was built with key human-centered interaction principles:

- Direct Manipulation: Users interact with shapes via mouse (click, drag, resize)
- User Control: Tool selection, color picking, undo/redo, and shape deletion
- Feedback: Hover effects, bounce animations, status messages, shape counter
- Error Prevention: Color validation, delete confirmations
- Designing for Fun: Playful design features like bounce effects and randomized coloring

How to Run:
